WiCS Bull Session
Discussion of courses offered Spring 2018
CS 104C Competitive Programming
Downing
Usually taught by Arnav and Ethan (two TAs)
Go through example sets
Homework is usually Codeforces
Lots of opportunities for extra credit
Really easy to pass, overkill for how much it teaches you for technical interviews
People learn things they learn in 331
Take it with Algorithms if you can, especially if theory isn’t your strong suit
Learn theory and how to implement it at the same time
You get as much out of it as you put into it
CS 109 Computer Programming in Python
Peters
■ Heard that any class that teaches you a specific language is a lot more
work than you think it is
■ Starts out very easy and project 3 and 4 take like 15 hours
■ Is pretty challenging
■ Is an ok lecturer, distracts himself by talking about other languages
■ Really really really solid grip on Python
■ If you really pay attention and work hard you can do well in the class

can apply unless you want to go into functional programming
■ Very theoretical course
● C S 347 Data Management
○ Cannata
■ This class is bad
■ Unstructured, kept constantly changing, don’t learn much at all

○ Downing
■ More of a class about C++ than OOP
■ Downing has a systematic way that he teaches lectures
■ OOP is easier than SWE
■ Projects don’t take more than 5 or 6 hours
■ Course is similar to SWE at the beginning

■ She’s working on some cool stuff in her research
■ A lot of it is conventional vision that isn’t being used in industry now
■ Doesn’t really touch on neural nets
■ Lots of her stuff is adversarial networks
■ If you want to learn vision good, but doesn’t apply to modern vision

if you can’t it’s not a good time
■ You’ll learn a lot, but be prepared for that
■ Extremely smart
■ Hard for him to come down to student level
■ Sense of humor is kind of degrading
■ Covers really cool stuff, a lot of math
Questions
Experience taking grad courses in CS as an undergrad- how hard is it to convince the professor?
Depends heavily on the professor. Some might require certain experience for them to sign off.
Lots of grad classes are highly specified, so if you don’t have the experience it might be a
struggle. Talk to the professor and get to know what they expect in their class.
What would y’all suggest taking as an upper division with Algo?
Algo is more conceptually difficult than a time commitment- but this depends heavily on how
your brain works. Something that doesn’t take lots of brainpower, even if it’s a time
commitment. High level of brain commitment, not high level of time commitment.
Recommendations with OS?
Don’t take anything else. If you have to take something that’s not a heavy time commitment.
Take your VAPA if you can. Don’t take another group work class. No algo and no graphics with
OS.
