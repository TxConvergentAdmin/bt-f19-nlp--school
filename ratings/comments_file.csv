CS 104C Competitive Programming,Downing, Usually taught by Arnav and Ethan (two TAs) , Go through example sets , Homework is usually Codeforces , Lots of opportunities for extra credit , Really easy to pass, overkill for how much it teaches you for technical interviews , People learn things they learn in 331 , Take it with Algorithms if you can, especially if theory isn’t your strong suit , Learn theory and how to implement it at the same time , You get as much out of it as you put into it
CS 109 Computer Programming in Python,Peters, Heard that any class that teaches you a specific language is a lot more work than you think it is , Starts out very easy and project 3 and 4 take like 15 hours , Is pretty challenging , Is an ok lecturer, distracts himself by talking about other languages , Really really really solid grip on Python , If you really pay attention and work hard you can do well in the class
CS 109 Ethical Foundation of CS,Norman, This is a new class and is only offered to freshmen , She’s really dedicated and goal driven , She can be kind of intense

CS 314 Data Structures,Scott, (See above)
CS 429(H) Comp Orgaization and Architecture,Young, Don’t take the 8am you’ll fall asleep , There’s a high chance you’ll fall asleep either way , Young is a really nice guy, but he’s a pretty dry lecturer , He does read from the ppt slides , If you go to office hours he’s really nice , Young is a little bit better of a lecturer than Novak , Information he gives is very good but it all runs together a lot of the time , Class can be a time sink if you’re not good at time management and starting right away
CS 429(H) Comp Orgaization and Architecture,Gheith (Honors), Gheith is an amazing lecturer , Really fun hard class , Class is a lot of work , Don’t take with anything hard
CS 331(H) Algorithms and Complexity,Fraij, He’s an ok lecturer , The homework is a lot of work , Can’t not pay attention and know everything right before the midterms

CS 345 Programming Languages,Cook, Learned Haskell and built an interpreter , Very helpful in office hours, but you won’t learn a ton about things you can apply unless you want to go into functional programming , Very theoretical course
CS 347 Data Management,Cannata, This class is bad , Unstructured, kept constantly changing, don’t learn much at all , Spent 5 or 6 weeks on SQL, learning SQL is easy, way too much time spent on this , Next part is APEX, felt very obscure, outsourced the final projects, lots of missing information, kept changing the design spec , Be weary , Several people seconded be weary
CS 354 Computer Graphics,Huang, Professor is new
CS 354R Game Technology,Abraham, You need to have an interest in making games or the class will be boring , The class is advertised as the final step before you enter industry in game dev , You can do the bare minimum and still get a good grade, but you have the opportunity to be creative and think outside the box , Groups are assigned and there are group projects , No exams in this class
CS 354T Game Dev Capstone: 3-D Games,Toprac, You have to apply
CS 356 Computer Networks,Gouda, Gouda used to teach 311, took a break , His lectures weren’t terrible but his grading was weird , Might lose points even if you’re right , Copied notes word for word onto the blackboard , Sometimes hard to follow , Answered questions well , Exams with Lam are challenging, book is necessary in Lam’s class
CS 361 Intro to Computer Security,Coffman-Wolf, Probably one of the easiest classes you can take , New professor, really nice , Still has no idea what she wants to do with the class , Currently read off the powerpoint, stuff you already know , Great class to take with OS , Very easy, projects are fun , Tries to make class interesting , Feels like it’s geared toward freshmen , Class might be changing

CS 371P Object Oriented Programming,Downing, More of a class about C++ than OOP , Downing has a systematic way that he teaches lectures , OOP is easier than SWE , Projects don’t take more than 5 or 6 hours , Course is similar to SWE at the beginning , Might not be worth it to take OOP and SWE , Don’t take with OS - it’s a lot of work , Heavy focus on details- have to know everything very well for the quizzes/tests , Background in C++ makes class easier , Projects aren’t hard at all , They’re just HackerRank programs , Downing is very detailed oriented , He cold calls in class to keep you engaged
CS 373 Software Engineering,Downing, SWE is Python , More about Software Engineering Principles in the second half, big project for the second half , Final project is really time consuming , Basically got a list of technologies to use , About ¾ of the time of OS, really heavy workload , Groups are large , Lots of stuff to do, especially if your group doesn’t know what they’re doing , Structure it out well from the start, otherwise you’re in trouble , One of few chances in the department to work in a large group , You get to make a lot of decisions on your own which is cool , Cold calls in class to keep you engaged , Very logical teaching style

CS 378 Randomized Algorithms,Zuckerman, This class with Price is really hard (note that this is geared toward PhDs in theory) , Note that this is undergrad and with a different professor
CS 378H Computer Graphics: Honors,Vouga, Vouga is an amazing lecturer , Class is a lot of math , Very linear algebra heavy
CS 378H Intro to Data Mining: Honors,Klivans, He’s really really smart , He knows he’s smart and can be a jerk about it, especially if you’re easily intimidated , Expects you to know things that you don’t necessarily know , Kind of really snarky, if you can roll with the punches he’s a great teacher, if you can’t it’s not a good time , You’ll learn a lot, but be prepared for that , Extremely smart , Hard for him to come down to student level , Sense of humor is kind of degrading , Covers really cool stuff, a lot of math
